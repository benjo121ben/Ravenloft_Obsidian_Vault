This is a vague recollection of everything that happened in the first chapter of our campaign.
[[Fezim]], a private investigator, [[Vartha]], an ex soldier, [[Olav]], a fisherman and [[Delmar]], a paladin of the god helm all meet in the city of [[Vallaki]] located in the land [[Barovia]]. They had all been transported into this region against their own will by a mysterious [[The Mist|mist]].
[[Fezim]] and [[Vartha]] had arrived there sooner, while [[Olav]] and [[Delmar]] had first landed in the small [[town of Barovia]].
Olav and Delmar had a couple of encounters with the Lord of the country. A vampire named [[Strahd von Zarovich]], who, at the time, had mostly kept to himself, but was nevertheless feared by the population.
These are the events that transpired before Fezim and Vartha joined the team:
 - Strahd von Zarovitch stole a collection of bones from Vallaki's local church, employing the help of a scoundrel named Millivoj, who had been working there and a local coffinmaker. This led to the church being desecrated, useless in defending against the vampire.
 - [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] was holding strange festivities, forcing people to smile and act jovial
 - Strahd had attempted multiple times to convince a townswoman from the [[town of Barovia]] by the name of [[Irina Kolyana]] to come with him and become his bride, but was met with strong disdain from Irina, which was then further met with attempts to kidnap her. She then fled to Vallaki's church, in hopes of being safe there.
 -  Olav and Delmar received a card reading from a [[Vistani|Vistana]] called Madame Eva, which outlined their destiny in the month to come. See [[First Tarot Card reading]] for more information.
 - Olav and Delmar ran into [[Van Richten|Rictavio]], a disguised monster hunter called Van Richten
 - [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] the town's governor was removed from his position by [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] a local noblewoman during a riot pre-ordained by Strahd. During this Event, called "The festival", his son [[Viktor]] attempted teleportation magic and went missing. This would not be important until much later.
[[Olav]] and [[Delmar]], after the attack on [[Vallaki]] and removal of the Baron, hire [[Fezim]], who had been acting as Lady Wachter's advisor, while collecting information about her, and [[Vartha]], who had been working with a local doctor to hone his skills as a field medic.
They then proceed to remove [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] and her cult-like following from power and entrust the handling of local affairs to the [[the Martikov family|Martikovs]] and other seemingly trustworthy townsfolk.
The Martikovs asked the team for help in delivering a message and getting a wine shipment from a nearby winery. This winery is run by their extended family, who hadn't been in contact for a concerningly long time.
