[[Grotto of Dementlieu]]
After leaving the grotto, Zesta smelts some of the trinkets down into a metal bar and sits with [[Olav]] on the pier in the hopes of testing whether it attracts the fish-people
Zesta goes shopping with Olav, we attend the party possibly held by [[Escher]].
[[Eschers party]] is held after this, we order him to head to [[Hazlan]].
Zesta investigates the strange material, to see whether the [[Fish-people]] can locate it even if smelted down.
Vartha has a fight with Olav but modifies his memory so he forgets. Zesta is very displeased by the fact that he just does this without any sort of remorse.
