#Session 

[[The dark Entity]] and the Aboleth seem to be a separate thing. The aboleth allow the entry of the Entity and are a form of separate-but-connnected entrance point for the entity.
The same goes for [[The Mist]], which is a manefestation of [[the dark entity]]
This theory is supported by [[Exethanter]] and [[Nepheron]]

Land in [[Sithicus]] due to a teleportation mishap
[[Nedragard Keep]], where two skeletons let us stay in the castle. 
They say their lord, [[Lord Soth]], does not want to speak to any guests and seems overall very secluded. We do not know who he is or why he does not seem to like having guests.

Castle was built by the [[Order of the Rose]]. [[Lord Soth]] was part of them. This was always his castle.
