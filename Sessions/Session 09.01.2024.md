Cute Interaction between Zesta and Ezmeralda, Vartha repays Olav with Wine.
We head to [[Vallachan]] on "The Relentless" with cpt "[[Pietra van Riesen]]".
Captain Pietra van Riesen was cursed and it seems that everyone on the ship seems to get cursed as well if they stay long enough.
We find personal belongings in a secret stash inside the ship, which seem to belong to far more people than are on the ship.
On the ship is also a small child called Jakob which is a ghost. He died during an expedition the captain made to find "foreign lands". Pietra is from literal real life Netherland and is trying to return there. She seems confused about when her condition started
We're leaving the ship on a beach in [[Vallachan]] and enter the jungle.
On our way along a river, we run into a bunch of wasp swarms and find a bunch of flowers which might help with our disease issues.
