The mist is a phenomenon spread all over the continent. It seems to be deadly to any who enter and those who survive are trapped by it in the confines of whatever region they find themselves in.

## Properties
- Separate areas from another, preventing travel for even powerful creatures such as [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and [[Azalin Rex]]. The [[Vistani]] or the use of a [[mist talisman]] seem to be able to circumvent this restriction
- The mist seems like it has some sort of deliberate purpose. It usually doesn't move, but when it does, it circles in whole areas. This behaviour hints at some intelligence controlling the mist
- [[Ezra]], an old god referenced in the histories of the continent, seems to have created artifacts that allow their wielder to fight back against the mist. with the [[Shield of Ezra]] repelling mist by its mere presence alone
