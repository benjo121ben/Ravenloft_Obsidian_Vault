Monster hunter, traveler and writer. Teacher of [[Ezmeralda]]
We have not met him yet, but he seems like quite the character.

We've seen his trailer parked infront of a tower in [[Barovia]]. It seems the tower was in some way assaulted, my notes do not mention whether that was in the past or recently.
He used a strange pose-based seal on his tower.
