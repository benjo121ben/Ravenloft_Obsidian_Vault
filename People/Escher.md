Escher was one of [[Strahd von Zarovich]]'s vampire spawns. After Strahds death he escaped to the City of [[Dementlieu]].
He was caught by [[the foreign wolves]] there, but after sparing him, they ordered him to travel to [[Hazlan]] to work as a spy for them. Currently he is in a relationship with [[Lady Laura]], a Dementlieuan noblewoman that provides him with blood.
