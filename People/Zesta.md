Zesta was a friendly smith based in the region of [[Borca]]. She operated out a shop in the area, selling mostly trinkets and doing repairs on equipment under her master. Learning the art of magic infusion, her abilities soon matched her master, who was an immensely skilled woman named [[Decca]].
It was as an apprentice at 17, when she met [[Ezmeralda]], a young aspiring monster hunter who had been severely injured during an excursion. Together they crafted her prosthetic, a device cleverly designed to fit the needs of a monster hunter. The two of them became very close, though the relationship eventually ended when Ezmeralda was fit enough to work again. _(Lovers maybe?)_

A couple of years later, Decca and Zesta were coerced to work for Lord [[Ivans secret project]]. Saying no would have been considered an act of treason, so the two agreed to submit to his will. After finding out the results would be used to fuel great warmachines, Decca, Zesta and many others tried to sabotage the project.
Ivan quickly caught wind of this and ordered for everyone involved to be killed discreetly in order to not cause suspicion within any of the other Artificers. 
Sabotaging some of the equipment, an explosion killed Decca, and most of her other conspirators. Zesta was horribly maimed in the "accident". 
She lost both her legs and right arm, barely surviving thanks to some of the artificers hiding her in an empty oil barrel for a week.
After her escape, she was forced to go undercover and escape from [[Borca]], crafting her armor in the process and later fleeing to [[Falcovnia]] in order to hide from [[Ivan]]
