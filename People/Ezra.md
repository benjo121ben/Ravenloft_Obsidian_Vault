A goddess who is said to have fought the mist but fell in battle. Was mortal at some point.
We don't know much about her so

It is said that her weapons, which are artifacts nowadays can help fend off evil. So far we know about:
- [[Shield of Ezra]]
- [[Gauntlets of Ezra]]
- [[Sword of Ezta]]

alive 90 years ago
gave up mortality while fighting an avatar of [[The dark Entity]]

*how come she left [[The Mist]] but doesn't really communicate with her followers, similar to the other gods that have been locked out*
