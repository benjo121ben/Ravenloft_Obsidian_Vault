Decca was an Artificer born in the Region of [[Borca]]. She operated out a shop in the area, selling mostly trinkets and doing repairs on equipment.
A 10 years ago, Decca and [[Zesta]], her apprentice were coerced to work for Lord [[Ivan]]. Saying no would have been considered an act of treason, so the two agreed to submit to his will to work on his [[Ivans secret project|project]].
After finding out that their work would be used for dangerous purposes, Decca started a small insurgency to sabotage the project. The Insurgency was short-lived and Decca and her co-conspirators were killed. [[Zesta]] managed to flee but was severely wounded in the process.
