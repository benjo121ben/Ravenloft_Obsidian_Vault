Humanoids, carrying barrels, [[Fish-people]]
Are collecting weird trinkets/accessoires in crates. A ring we are looking for might be in there.
We confront them and a mighty crab arises. [[Olav]] kills it.
We find some sort of logbook
Wound of family that was killed in [[Murder in Dementlieu]] was caused by these things. They seem to be able to locate the metal.
Zesta pours the trinkets from the grotto into the portable hole.
We give the ring back to him, maybe the things will come for him and kill him.
