City state in the west of the continent, placed along the coast. 
It is cut off from one of its neighbours through the mists.
Dementlieu's populace seems quite obsessed with presenting themselves in the latest fashion as well as following the latest trends and throwing the biggest parties.
Overall the populace lives in quite good conditions and many merchants come through the area to trade. The city also has a harbor which allows it to access the Seas in the west.
