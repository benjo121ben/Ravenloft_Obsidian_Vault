A family of nobles was brutally murdered by some [[Fish-people]] who only took a ring made of weird metal.
We recovered the ring in [[Grotto of Dementlieu]] and brought it back to the owner. (Who is probably gonna die now as well), since they seem to be able to locate the trinkets in some way or another.
