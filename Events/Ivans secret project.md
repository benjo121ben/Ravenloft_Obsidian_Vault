5 years ago [[Ivan]], Lord of [[Borca]] started a secret project.
He coerced many of his country's greatest smiths, to produce a powerful energy resource which Ivan claimed "could be used to greatly advance the country's economic power". 
This project was a farce, to convince these great artists to work on something they thought would help the populace and bring prosperity, but instead would be used to supply great war machines Ivan was building. Some of the artists including [[Decca]]  and [[Zesta]] found out and planned to sabotage the operation, as well as escape from Ivan. This disobedience was quickly dealt with as Ivan ordered their disposal via explosion, caused by a sabotaged device. Everyone except for Zesta died in this "accident".
As far as is known today, he continues to work on this project.
